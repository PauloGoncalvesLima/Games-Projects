Just like the original, you try to keep the bird in the air for as long as possible. One point is awarded for each obstacle you clear.

## How to Run

### Windows
Run the "Flappy Bird.exe" file under the "./Build" directory.

### Other
Although we have not tested on other platforms, you should be able to open the project folder with Unity (version: 2019.1.11f1 or later) and build for your desired platform.

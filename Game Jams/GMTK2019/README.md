# Sole Spotlight

A game made for the 2019 edition of the annual game jam [GMTK](https://gmtk.itch.io/). The theme for the [GMTK2019](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019) jam was *"Only one"*.

## Demo

The room is completely dark and there is Only One Spotlight to illuminate it. Use your cursor to swing the spotlight by clicking and holding on the light beam. There is an exit in each room and its your job to guide the frightened little guy to it. But beware! If he is out of the light for too long he will become too scared to move and you'll have to try again. There are also some obstacles along the way, so be sure to keep him safe!
